# Hover Effect Button
This repository contains a simple HTML and CSS code snippet that creates an interactive hover effect button. When you hover over the button, it displays a captivating animation. Below, the working and explanation of the code are detailed.

## Demo
You can see a live demo of the hover effect button by opening the index.html file in your web browser or visiting : 

**https://hover-effect-buttons.vercel.app/**

## Features
**Interactive Hover Effect**: The button exhibits a vibrant gradient animation and blurring effect on hover, providing an engaging user experience.

**Versatility**: The code is written in a way that allows easy customization. You can adjust button size, colors, and animation speed to fit your design requirements.

## How it Works
### HTML Structure
The HTML file (index.html) contains two button elements wrapped inside outer div elements. Each button has two span elements that create the blur effect on hover.

<div class="outer button">
    <button>Click Me</button>
    <span></span>
    <span></span>
</div>
<div class="outer circle">
    <button>Click Me</button>
    <span></span>
    <span></span>
</div>

### CSS Styles
The styles are defined in the style.css file. Key aspects of the styles include:

#### General Styles: 
Applies a CSS reset by setting margin, padding, and box-sizing to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
#### Body Styles:
**body**: Sets the body to be a grid container, horizontally and vertically centered with a black background.
#### Centering Styles:
**.center**: Uses flexbox to horizontally and vertically center its children elements.
#### Button Container Styles:
**.outer**: Defines a common style for both button containers, setting position to relative, adding margin, and setting a black background.
#### Button Styles:
**.button and .circle**: Styles for button dimensions and border-radius to create a circular shape for the .circle class.
#### Button and Span Positioning:
**outer button and outer span**: Positions the button and span elements at the center of their parent (.outer) using absolute positioning and transform property.
#### Button Text Styles:
**outer button**: Styles the button text with a black background, light gray text color, no outline, and a pointer cursor.
#### Blur Effect on Hover:
**.outer:hover span:nth-child(1) and .outer:hover span:nth-child(2)**: Applies a blur effect to the first and second span child elements of .outer when hovered over, creating a smooth transition effect.
#### Gradient and Animation on Hover:
**.outer:hover**: On hover, applies a linear gradient background transitioning from cyan to yellow to a pinkish shade. Also applies the circling animation for a rotating hue effect.
#### Hue Rotation Animation:
**@keyframes circling**: Defines the circling animation, which smoothly rotates the hue of the button from 0 to 360 degrees, creating a looping color animation.
